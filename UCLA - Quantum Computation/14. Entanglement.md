# Entanglement

Remember that in the state evolutions of the last lecture, we said that $\ket{1, 0}$ was already in the "groundest" state, so it has nowhere to go. But the $\ket{1, n > 0}$ states can evolve to $\ket{0, n-1}$.

So for example, if instead of having a "single" state, our QHO gets into a superposition before evolving? We'll have:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ket{\psi_0} &= \ket{1} \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\ket{0} + \ket{2}) \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{1, 0} + \ket{1, 2} \\
\text{After evolution:} \\
\Rightarrow  \ket{\psi_t} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big(\ket{1, 0} + \ket{0, 1}) \neq \ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_2}
\end{align*}
$$

## Coupling two or more qubits via a QHO (bosonic mode)

In the following designs, the QHO mediates the coupling between the two qubits.

So, let's put **two qubits** in an optical cavity! \
We'll assume both qubits are of the same type so they'll have the same state separation.

We can write the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of this system as:

$$
\frac{\hat{H}}{\hbar} = \frac{\omega_0}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z^{(1)} + \frac{\omega_0}{2}\hat{\sigma}_z^{(2)} + \omega(\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}) + \frac{g}{2} \big( \hat{a} (\hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} + \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)}) + \hat{a}^{\dagger} (\hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)}) \big)
$$

When dealing with these things, it's useful to first try to figure out how to make the Hilbert space smaller, so we won't have to think about all of the $\infty$-dimensional space. \
We can do that by picking a state we care about and then operating on it by a hamiltonian.

$$
\frac{\hat{H}}{\hbar}\ket{1, 1, 1} = (-\frac{\omega_0}{2} - \frac{\omega_0}{2} + \frac{3 \omega}{2})\ket{1, 1, 1} + \frac{g}{2} (\ket{0, 1, 0} + \ket{1, 0, 0})
$$

Where our state has the form $\ket{Q_1, Q_2, QHO}$.

Therefore our Hilbert subspace of interest will be the one that contains the states $\ket{1, 1, 1}$ and $\ket{0, 1, 0}$ and $\ket{1, 0, 0}$.

$$
\ket{\psi} = a \ket{1, 1, 1} + b \ket{1, 0, 0} + c \ket{0, 1, 0} = \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}
$$

We can then write every entry of the matrix form of the hamiltonian by sandwiching it with different states from the subspace (it's going to be a $3 \times 3$ matrix):

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\hat{H}}{\hbar} &= \begin{pmatrix}
-\omega_0 + \frac{3\omega}{2} & g/2 & g/2 \\
g/2 & \frac{\omega}{2} & 0 \\
g/2 & 0 & \frac{\omega}{2}
\end{pmatrix} \\
\, \\
& \text{Assuming } \omega_0 - \omega = 0 = \delta \text{ : (???)} \\
\, \\
&= \frac{\omega}{2} \hat{I} + \begin{pmatrix}
0 & g/2 & g/2 \\
g/2 & 0 & 0 \\
g/2 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can exponentiate this thing but it's like a $3 \times 3$ matrix so it's going to be a bit of a pain. Instead, we'll do something called **Adiabatic Elimination**.

What we want to understand here is the dynamics of this Hamiltonian, the $\hat{I}$ term is just an energy (phase) shift, so we can just ignore it and focus on the $2$nd part.

So we put this thing and our $\ket{\psi}$ into the Schrodinger equation to get the following equations describing the time-evolution of our state's amplitudes:

$$
\begin{align*}
i \dot{a} &= \delta a + \frac{g}{2} (b + c) \\
i \dot{b} &= \frac{g}{2} a \\
i \dot{c} &= \frac{g}{2} a
\end{align*}
$$

Here's where the _adiabatic elimination_ comes in, so let's assume that  **$\delta >> g$**. \
Then we can just ignore the $g$ term in the first equation to get:

$$
a = e^{-i \delta t} a_0
$$

Since $\delta$ is very big, this means that the oscillation is basically "constant" because it oscillates too fast, which means that $a = a_0 \implies \dot{a} = 0$, putting this back into the set of three equations gives us:

$$
\begin{align*}
a &= -\frac{g}{2\delta} (b + c) \\
i \dot{b} &= -\frac{g^2}{4\delta} (b + c) \\
i \dot{c} &= -\frac{g^2}{4\delta} (b + c)
\end{align*}
$$

And this is exactly what you'd expect, right? Because the $b$ term is the state of one qubit excited, and the $c$ term is the state of the other qubit excited, so they're both going to be coupled to the state $\ket{1, 1, 1}$ with the exact same coupling.

(You can think of this as the amplitudes "tunneling" through the $0$ portion of the Hamiltonian matrix)

This shows that the evolution of $b, c$ are now totally uncoupled from $a$! \
Putting the last two equations back into the matrix form of the Schrodinger equation, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
i \frac{d}{dt} \ket{\psi} &= \frac{\hat{H}}{\hbar} \ket{\psi} \\
\begin{pmatrix}
i \dot{b} \\
i \dot{c}
\end{pmatrix} &= \begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{g^2}{4\delta} & -\frac{g^2}{4\delta} \\
-\frac{g^2}{4\delta} & -\frac{g^2}{4\delta}
\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
b \\
c
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

So we now see that our Hilbert Space has been reduced from keeping track of $3$ states to just $2$ states! We can write down our statevector as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\ket{\psi} &= b \ket{1, 0, 0} + c \ket{0, 1, 0} \\
&= \big( b \ket{1, 0} + c \ket{0, 1} \big) \otimes \ket{0} \\
&= b \ket{1, 0} + c \ket{0, 1}
\end{align*}
$$

Since both of the states have the same QHO mode, we can just stop keeping track of that part!

Now, let's write our "effective" hamiltonian in terms of raising and lowering operators:

$$
\frac{\hat{H}_{eff}}{\hbar} = \frac{-g^2}{4 \delta} \hat{I} - \frac{-g^2}{4 \delta} \Big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \Big)
$$

(To go from $\ket{0, 1} to \ket{1, 0}$, one of the qubits need to be lowered and the other one raised.) \
You can also think about it as the QHO mediating the interaction between the two qubits, so the QHO is just a "passive" mode that doesn't do anything, as one of the qubits emits a photon, the other one absorbs it, and vice versa. That's why this type of Hamiltonian is called a **Spin-Exchange Hamiltonian**.

Now let's unpack these things a little bit, what is $\frac{-g^2}{4 \delta} \hat{I}$? It's an **AC Stark Shift**, we don't actually care too much _here_ because both of our qubits get shifted together, therefore we can just ignore it! \

Finally:

$$
\frac{\hat{H}_{eff}}{\hbar} = \frac{-g^2}{4 \delta} \Big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \Big)
$$

This has $0$ reference to the existence of a QHO, and we can just exponentiate this to find the evolution. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{U}_{eff} &= e^{-i \frac{\hat{H}_{eff}}{\hbar} t} = e^{-i \frac{-g^2}{4 \delta} \Big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \Big) t} \\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n!} (\frac{-i g^2 t}{4\delta})^{2n} \big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \big)^{2n} + \sum{odds}
\end{align*}
$$

Where we see that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \big)^2 &= (\hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)})^2 + (\hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)})^2 + \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} \\
&= |0_1 \rangle \langle 0_1 | \otimes |1_2 \rangle \langle 1_2 | + |1_1 \rangle \langle 1_1 | \otimes |0_2 \rangle \langle 0_2 | \\
&= |0 1 \rangle \langle 1 0 | + |1 0 \rangle \langle 0 1 | \\
&= \hat{I}
\end{align*}
$$

(The two terms squared are going to be zero because raising/lowering a state 2 times in a row gives zero, and for the two middle terms we have to notice that they're tensor products, so the terms relating to each qubit get multiplied together, which ends up in this)

And for the $\sum{odds}$ term, it's going to be the same thing, but powered to $2n+1$ instead of $2n$, which means that only one $\hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)}$ term will be left. So we can just write:

$$
\hat{U}_{eff} = \cos(\frac{g^2}{4\delta} t) \hat{I} + i \sin(\frac{g^2}{4 \delta}t) \big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \big)
$$

Now, suppose that $(\frac{g^2}{4\delta} t) = \frac{\pi}{4}$, then the values of $\cos$ and $\sin$ equal $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and the $2x2$ form of the $\hat{U}_{eff}$ matrix is:

$$
\hat{U}_{eff} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
1 & i \\
i & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Now assuming that our initial state is:

$$
\ket{\psi} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 
0
\end{pmatrix} = \ket{10}
$$

Operating on it with $\hat{U}_{eff}$ gives us:

$$
\hat{U}_{eff} \ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
i
\end{pmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{10} + \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{01}
$$

Which is an entangled state between **two qubits**! Remember that previously, we only could entangle our qubit to modes of the QHO, but now we can entangle it to **another qubit**!

In another words, we have these two transmon/superconducting/atomic qubits in a cavity, and we have one of them excited, we bring the cavity on resonance for a time such that the pulse area $\frac{g^2}{4\delta} t = \frac{\pi}{4}$, and then we pull it off resonance. Which means we stopped the process mid-way through the rabi cycle, which brings the first qubit into a superposition of emitting and not emitting, and the second qubit into a superposition of absorbing and not absorbing.

So this is what it means for the QHO to be the mediator of an interaction between qubits! This wouldn't have happened without the QHO, and it's the QHO that allows the photon to be exchanged between the two qubits, but at the end of the day we don't even have to think about the QHO part.

As a final note, our effective hamiltonian can be also written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\hat{H}_{eff}}{\hbar} &= \frac{g^2}{4\delta} \big( \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_{-}^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_{+}^{(2)} \big) \\
&= \frac{g^2}{4\delta} \big( \frac{1}{2} (\hat{\sigma}_x^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_x^{(2)} + \hat{\sigma}_y^{(1)} \hat{\sigma}_y^{(2)}) \big)
\end{align*}
$$
