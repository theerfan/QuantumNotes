# The one posted for midterm

Here's a little list of light reading that covers most of what we've discussed in lecture. It's not required that you read this but if you'd like to brush up on things, I think you'll find these helpful. 

I'll list a topic and then a recommended source:

Linear Algebra: David Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Chapter 3 Formalism (in my edition). I've heard that newer additions have an extra appendix on formalism and linear algebra

Schrodinger equation basics:

Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 (especially 2.3) in David Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Spin:

Section 4.4 in David Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Time-evolution operators: 

Section 2.2 of J.J. Sakurai Quantum Mechanics (he goes through the Schrodinger vs. Heisenberg picture which is sort of an old fashioned way of thinking about things to me so we didn't introduce that language, but the rest of it shows the basic math behind it all)

Quantum Harmonic Oscillators:

Section 2.3 of David Griffiths Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Section 2.3 of J.J. Sakurai Quantum Mechanics


Qubit and Bloch sphere:

There are loads of online resources here. For example, the Qiskit textbook has: https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-states/representing-qubit-states.html

Links to an external site.

 

If you have other references that you think should be on this list, let me know and I'll update it as we go.
