        "Block encoding with matrix access oracles\n=========================================\n\nProminent quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation and\nquantum singular value transformation sometimes need to use\n**non-unitary** matrices inside quantum circuits. This is problematic\nbecause quantum computers can only perform unitary evolutions \ud83d\udd25. Block\nencoding is a technique that solves this problem by embedding a\nnon-unitary operator as a sub-block of a larger unitary matrix \ud83e\uddef.\n\nIn previous demos we have discussed methods for\n[simulator-friendly](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_intro_qsvt#transforming-matrices-encoded-in-matrices)\nencodings and block encodings using [linear combination of\nunitaries](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_lcu_blockencoding)\n(LCU) decompositions. In this tutorial we explore another general block\nencoding framework that can be very efficient for sparse and structured\nmatrices: block encoding with matrix access oracles.\n\n![](../_static/demonstration_assets/block_encoding/thumbnail_Block_Encodings_Matrix_Oracle.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nA general circuit for block encoding an arbitrary matrix\n$A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times N}$ with $N = 2^{n}$ can be constructed as\nshown in the figure below, if we have access to the oracles $U_A$ and\n$U_B$:\n\n![](../_static/demonstration_assets/block_encoding/general_circuit.png){.align-center\nwidth=\"50.0%\"}\n\nWhere the $H^{\\otimes n}$ operation is a Hadamard transformation on $n$\nqubits. The $U_A$ operation is an oracle which encodes the matrix\nelement $A_{i,j}$ into the the amplitude of the ancilla qubit. The $U_B$\noracle ensures that we iterate over every combination of $(i,j)$.\n\nFinding an optimal quantum gate decomposition that implements $U_A$ and\n$U_B$ is not always possible. We now explore two different approaches\nfor constructing these oracles that can be very efficient for matrices\nwith specific structure or sparsity.\n\nBlock encoding structured matrices\n----------------------------------\n\nIn order to better understand the oracle access framework, let us first\ndefine $U_A$ and $U_B$ for the exact block-encoding of $A$. The $U_A$\noracle is responsible for encoding the matrix entries of $A$ into the\namplitude of an auxilary qubit $|0\\rangle_{\\text{anc}}$:\n\n$$U_A |0\\rangle_{\\text{anc}} |i\\rangle |j\\rangle = |A_{i,j}\\rangle_{\\text{anc}} |i\\rangle |j\\rangle,$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$|A_{i,j}\\rangle_{\\text{anc}} \\equiv A_{i,j}|0\\rangle_{\\text{anc}} + \\sqrt{1 - |A_{i,j}|^2}|1\\rangle_{\\text{anc}}.$$\n\nThe $U_B$ oracle is responsible for ensuring proper indexing of each\nentry in $A$ and for this algorithm, it simplifies to be the\n`~.pennylane.SWAP`{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} gate:\n\n$$U_B |i\\rangle|j\\rangle \\ = \\ |j\\rangle |i\\rangle$$\n\nThe naive approach is to construct $U_A$ using a sequence of\nmulti-controlled $Ry(\\alpha)$ rotation gates with rotation angles\ncomputed as $\\alpha = \\text{arccos}(A_{i,j})$. It turns out that this\nrequires $O(N^{4})$ gates and is very inefficient. A more efficient\napproach is the Fast Approximate BLock Encodings (FABLE) technique,\nwhich uses the oracle access framework and some clever approximations \ud83e\udde0.\nThe level of approximation in FABLE can be adjusted to simplify the\nresulting circuit. For matrices with specific structures, FABLE provides\nan efficient circuit *without* reducing accuracy.\n\nThe FABLE circuit is constructed from a set of single $Ry$ rotation and\nC-NOT gates. We can remove the need for multi-controlled rotations using\na special transformation of the angles (see for details). The rotation\nangles, $(\\theta_1, ..., \\theta_n)$, are obtained from a transformation\nof the elements of the block-encoded matrix.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\theta_n \\end{pmatrix} =\nM \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_1 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\alpha_n \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe angles $\\alpha$ are obtained from the matrix elements of the matrix\n$A$ as $\\alpha_1 = \\text{arccos}(A_{00}), ...,$ and $M$ is the\ntransformation matrix that can be obtained with the\n`~.pennylane.templates.state_preparations.mottonen.compute_theta`{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"func\"} function of PennyLane.\n\nLet\\'s now construct the FABLE block encoding circuit for a structured\nmatrix.\n"

        "You can see that the compressed circuit is equivalent to the original\ncircuit. This happens because our original matrix is highly structured\nand many of the rotation angles are zero. However, this is not always\ntrue for an arbitrary matrix. Can you construct another matrix that\nallows a significant compression of the block encoding circuit without\naffecting the accuracy?\n\nBlock encoding sparse matrices\n==============================\n\nThe quantum circuit for the oracle $U_A$, presented above, accesses\nevery entry of $A$ and thus requires $~ O(N^2)$ gates to implement the\noracle. In the special cases where $A$ is structured and sparse, we can\ngenerate a more efficient quantum circuit representation for $U_A$ and\n$U_B$ by only keeping track of the non-zero entries of the matrix.\n\nLet $b(i,j)$ be a function such that it takes a column index $j$ and\nreturns the row index for the $i^{th}$ non-zero entry in that column of\n$A$. Note, in this formulation, the $|i\\rangle$ qubit register now\nrefers to the number of non-zero entries in $A$. For sparse matrices,\nthis can be much smaller than $N$, thus saving us many qubits. We use\nthis to define $U_A$ and $U_B$.\n\nLike in the structured approach, the $U_A$ oracle is responsible for\nencoding the matrix entries of $A$ into the amplitude of the ancilla\nqubit. However, we now use $b(i,j)$ to access the row index of the\nnon-zero entries:\n\n$$U_A |0\\rangle_{\\text{anc}} |i\\rangle |j\\rangle = |A_{b(i,j),j}\\rangle_{\\text{anc}} |i\\rangle |j\\rangle,$$\n\nIn this case the $U_B$ oracle is responsible for implementing the\n$b(i,j)$ function and taking us from the column index to the row index\nin the qubit register:\n\n$$U_B |i\\rangle|j\\rangle \\ = \\ |i\\rangle |b(i,j)\\rangle$$\n\nLet\\'s work through an example. Consider the sparse matrix given by:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\alpha & \\gamma & 0 & \\dots & \\beta\\\\\n\\beta & \\alpha & \\gamma & \\ddots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\beta & \\alpha & \\gamma \\ddots & 0\\\\\n0 & \\ddots & \\beta & \\alpha & \\gamma\\\\\n\\gamma & 0 & \\dots & \\beta & \\alpha \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are real numbers. The following\ncode block prepares the matrix representation of $A$ for an $8 \\times 8$\nsparse matrix.\n"

        "You can confirm that the circuit block encodes the original sparse\nmatrix defined above. Note that if we wanted to increase the dimension\nof $A$ (for example $16 \\times 16$), then we need only to add more wires\nto the `j` register in the device and in `UB`.\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nBlock encoding is a powerful technique in quantum computing that allows\nus to implement a non-unitary operation in a quantum circuit by\nembedding the operation in a larger unitary gate. In this tutorial, we\nreviewed two important block encoding methods with code examples using\nPennyLane. This allows you to use PennyLane to explore and benchmark\nseveral block encoding approaches for a desired problem. The efficiency\nof the block encoding methods typically depends on the sparsity and\nstructure of the original matrix. We hope that you can use these tips\nand tricks to find a more efficient block encoding for your matrix!\n\nReferences\n==========\n"
